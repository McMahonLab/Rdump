# Rdump
### Rdump is a repository created by Charles Olmsted where he put all his vaguely labeled R code used for various tasks. 
### Most code can be run in order... but not all of it. So... good luck to those who intend to use it.
### Rdump is intended to be a place for other's future Rcode to be deposited as well. Try to label and explain things better than Charles.
